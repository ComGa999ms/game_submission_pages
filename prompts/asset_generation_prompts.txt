"Suggest CSS styles for a 2D news card game interface (FakeFeed): Clean, centered layout with gradient backgrounds (light blue for menu, white cards for play). Include responsive button hover effects, progress bar animation, and feedback boxes with green/red borders for correct/incorrect. Use variables for colors (primary: #3498db, success: #27ae60). No images; text-based icons like emojis for icons. Ensure dark/light theme compatibility and mobile stacking for buttons."

Response Summary: Adopted gradient overlays and pulse animations for engagement; refined media queries for screens under 600px; no visual assets generated, kept text-based for simplicity.
