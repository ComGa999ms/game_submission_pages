Prompt used with Grok (xAI) on October 20, 2025:

"Debug and refine this JS code for FakeFeed game: Fix shuffle to prevent duplicates in 10 selections from 20 items. Add disable/enable buttons after guess to prevent multiple clicks. Update score display to 'Correct: X / Y questions' with animation. Ensure async handling for potential API gen (fallback to static). Improve parsing for AI responses if integrated. Test win/lose logic (â‰¥6 correct = win with trophy icon). Output updated script.js snippet."

Response Summary: Implemented button disable with opacity/cursor changes; added score update function with class-based animation; refined shuffle with copy-spread to avoid mutation; conditional result icons for engagement.
